    <ul>
       <li> We will be evaluating Bulbapedia.</li>
       <li> The websites target audience are pokemon fans who want to know more about the game, like stats and moves.</li>
       <li>The Site uses Hiearchical Organization.</li>
        <li>The Crap priniciple Repitition is used to make the website consitent. </li>
        <li>Bulbapedia is a great website because it has a lot of information about Pokemon.</li>
        <li>Unfortunately the has a low accessibility score of 59%.</li>
        <li>With 131 critical issues blind, deafblind, low vision, and low contrast are affected by the lack of accessibility.</li>
        <li>I would say Bulbapedia is an effective website and supports its user in completing actions accurately.</li>
        <li>I would also that after using the site efficent and easy to use.</li>
        <li>It is also pleasant to use and appropriate.</li>
        <li>I feel that Bulbapedia could use a UI/UX design update to make it more accessible and to improve the design of the website.</li>
